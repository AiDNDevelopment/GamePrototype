Prototype of a game made in unity. 

Showcases some basics within unity and is a testbed for game related features im working on.

Currently shows: 
- Basic Third person camera and player controller, 
- Basic Navmesh for enemy patrol and AI
- simple health system for a defense point using unity canvas
- My busted ass broken code that probably makes no sense but i tried to comment it anyways
